Selfie Face detection - Proof Of Concept
========================================

Key features include:

    Set target image resolution
    Zoom-in
    Face rotation for upright positioning
    Exposure/brightness adjustment
    Color saturation enhancement

Here's how it works:

    Monitored Folder: Automatically processes images (jpg and png) placed in this folder.
    Result Folder: Saves processed images.
    Processed Folder: Moves already processed images from "Monitored" to "Processed."

User Interaction:

    Users place image(s) in the "Monitored" folder.
    Automatic detection triggers processing.
    Processed face images (jpg) are stored in the "Result" folder.
    Processed images are then moved to the "Processed" folder.

All folder names and paths are configurable.

Please note that this is a Proof of Concept (POC), not the final product. Its purpose is to showcase the feasibility of meeting your requirements.
